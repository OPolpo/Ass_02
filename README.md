A very simple planetary System with opengl made for First Assignment of Surface and volumetric data rendering visualization class.

This is just a little example of how to use opengl for:

- printing some 3D object

- animate them

- apply some texture

- illuminate the environment and the oject

The system is composed by two planets that orbits around a star with different orbital and rotation periods.

Some cool feature are added:

- a pretty sphere with a texture of the rest of the universe.

- an extra flat *Tardis* that seems move randomly in the universe
